I've set it up so it reads bitmaps and commands.

Parsing works from CANTParse2.

Vision is a stub/net.

I've added a control net so it's either parsing or acting.

I've added an act net.
  We'll need to test this to omit an action.
  
I'll need to get it to switch from parsing to acting when parsing is done.
   Currently I can't get the switch pattern to work.  Once that's fixed:
   
Parsing should suppress action

Actions need to be linked to words that are activated via the stack in the
action phase.

After the action is done, I'll need to go back to parsing mode.

Eventually I should remove the symbolic switch at the end of parsing by just
  checking stacktop has stopped.
