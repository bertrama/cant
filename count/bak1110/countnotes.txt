This system should allow the user to select a number and get the next, or
to count from a number (S) to another number (F).  

The topology is an input layer including 12 numbers, F and Plus. (14*200=2800) 
How does the user set S and F? (The user sets F, it binds, and the count
  starts when S is set.)
There is a layer for the internal representation (it may hold extra states),
and a layer for the rules.
There is a binding layer that stores the binding of F.

note there was a problem with memory overload which I changed in the project
  interpretter options

This seems to work most of the time for the 2+1 rules etc.  

Now to move on to the binding. In steps
  1. Get F bound to an internal number
  2. Start at S
  3. Move from S to S+1, etc.
  4. Stop at F.

Currently
  I had binding working with the current topology though 
     it did work too well.  Rules seem to work pretty well.  
     So, now to check that binding
	 works appropriately without breaking rules.
