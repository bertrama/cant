CANT23 comes from Chris's CANT22a.  The big change is that 
I've subclassed CANT23 so that we can make new systems without 
changing the core files.  This was pretty easy for CANTExperiment
but harder for CANTNet.  I had to create a null net of the appropriate
type in the subclassed CANT23.  I then passed this to NetMgr
which called back a special function getNewNet which creates
the net of the appropriate type.

It works for count and I expect for the default.

It hasn't been translated for the hier, add, and vb stuff in
CANT22a.
