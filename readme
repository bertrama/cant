This is the code for the variable binding experiments described by Huyck

It's just standard java, but the paths for the vb directory are important.
If you move the java files in the vb directory up, you'll have to rename
the xml file variables in the java files in that directory.

Some .bat files are provided.
If you unzip this, you should first 
run compilebase.bat (you may need to modify the .bat file so the path points
  to your javac).
cd vb
compilevb.bat (again, you may need to modify the path to point to javac but
also modify the classpath to point to the directory with CANT23 in it)
cd ..
runvb.bat

That should run the fast bind experiment.

If you want to run the ltp experiment, go to the CANT23VB file and
set runFastBindTest=false; (6 lines down).

If you want to modify the epoch lengths, try to modify the trainBaseCAs
and bindEpochLength settings in the constructor.
