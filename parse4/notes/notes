I brought this from parse3.  Parse3 is a nice start but needs major rework,
hence the switch.  The things (from parse3/thoughts/notes) that are needed 
are:

  1. Separate bar-two rules from bar-one rules and use less decay to
allow better semantic input.
  2. Add extra slot rules.
  3. Incorporate more flexibility in the oracle to allow hierarchical 
influences.
  4. Sort out instance problems (shortness and symbolic reset).

Allowed nouns and verbs (Access -> Semantics) to be read from a file. Could
also add in input to access for noun, verb, and other.  Could also add
in access->rule.

There was a problem with an actor rule.  Fix that.  Need to hook in
time from NPs.  I did this and it now works for Move left. Center the
pyramid. I found the gun. and The pyramid is to the left.  It is
closely timed.

I will need to put time into VPs (5.) and hook them in. Put this in.

6. I'm also going to need to figure out timing.  

I put instrument in and it took a couple of hours.  Don't forget the
instrument done feature.

I adjusted timing and it's close.  Sep1908

7. np v pp can attach the pp to the np.  Need to close off the np.  This
will require a done feature for an instance, and that linked in to things.

Added NPAddsAdj rule.

1,2,5,6 done.  7 Can defer indefinitely.

Hierarchical influences added.  There is a problem here that multiple 
connections to the same preference rule keep only the last.  There is
also a lack of preposition influence on the decision.

8. I should also remove the symbolic noruleactive hook (undone in Experiment)

The instance problem is sorted out.  It now does this subsymbolically.  It
does do a reset after every parse.

Oh, I also now close off the NP using a feature.  This feature only prevents 
the VP -> NPact VP rule.
