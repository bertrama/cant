It looks like there's not too much done with the control net.  
It is only currently used for setting the goalSet.

What's done symbolically is:
1  read a word
2  setReadNextWordRule
3  setBarOneOn (at the start).
4  setNewInstance
5  parseDone to 
5a     clearparsenets
5b     turn input off
5c     set verbinstanceon
5d     setcontrolon
5e     set goalSetOn
6  setverbinstance off (after goal set)
7  see if goal done to 
7a    resetinstancebinding
7b    startParsing next sentence
7c    set input back on.
8  emit action

All except 1, 7a and 8 should be done subsymbolically.

-----------------------------------------------------

2 is done by waiting 10 cycles since last time any rule fired then
turning on the readNextWordRule

3 Might be ok to do symbolically.

5 ParseDone is simply having a particular rule on.  
   turn off all parse nets
   turn on verbinstance
   get goal set  (time?)
   turn off goalset
     resetinstancebinding  
 
6. start parsing again 
   turn baroneon

----------------------------
a. get parsing, and goal setting working
   parse finishes (control state 0)
   clear parse nets (control state 1) 
   set verbinstance1 (control state 2)
     get goal set (timed)
   clear nets after goal set (control state 3)
   start next parse. (control state 4)
     symbolic clear fast bind neurons  (Done)
b. figure out next word.
c. figure out next instance.
d. figure out symbolic fast bind reset.
