There are problems with the goaling system when there are multiple 
objects.  

There are at least 5 questions to ask about having multiple objects.

1. How do we bind?
2. How do we activate?
3. What about 2 objects of the same type?
4. What about just one item?
5. What happens when the objects move?

I came up with three possible solutions.
1. Bind by STP
2. Bind by active links (or something like them)
3. Query the environment.

I think the easiest is to query the environment.  So, I'm going to try that.
Here's the idea.  
When the user says Turn toward the pyramid (ignore Roman's learning 
restriction), the goal pyramid is activated.
This sends extra activation to the V2 pyramid item.
That item is now active enough to turn on the position fact.
That can then be used to resolve the query.

The starving donkey problem arises with two pyramids, and the Go to the 
pyramid command.  The system has to pick one and stick with it.  This
might be enabled by inhibition in V2.
