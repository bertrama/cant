I did this all in a DOS window.  
To compile the code use the compileparse.bat file.
You will need to change the path to javac to where your javac is.  This stuff has compiled and run on several version of java.

Then use the runparse.bat file to run the parser.
Click on the start button on the base net and it should start parsing.
