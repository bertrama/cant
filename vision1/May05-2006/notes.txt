This should plug right into the top level and work.  (I'm hoping to change
propogate change so all the nets change at the same time instead of serially,  this might lead to a problem.)

It recognizes up facing triangles and down facing triangles.  It
probably won't work if they're off center from the activation point,
but that could be fixed relatively easily by putting in excitatory
connection to adjacent activation points.

The retina has on-off and off-on receptors with 3x3, 6x6 and 9x9 receptive
fields.  That seems ok, but we certainly don't take full advantage of
them.

The triangle recognizers work essentially by getting the correct 
orientation and location lines from 3x3 on-off; correct angles with 
locations from 6x6 on-off, and centering information from 9x9 off-on.

It has a number of problems that I'm not comfortable with.

The activation point thing is really not very good.  Why should 
just one neuron come on if a triangle is present?

There are no back connections from say V2 to V1.  These should make
things better.

I think we use too many neurons.  I'm sure a similar job could be
done with fewer neurons.
