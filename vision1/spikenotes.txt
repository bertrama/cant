For 3x3 on/off, value = (on - (off/8))
  1, 0 = 1
  1, 1 = .87
  1, 2 = .75
  1, 3 = .62
  1, 4 = .5
Anything below .5 does not fire

For 3x3 off/on, valu = ((off/8) - on)
  8,0 =  1
  7,0 = .87
  6,0 = .75
  5,0 = .62
  4,0 = .5

For 6x6 on/off, value = ((on/4) - (off/32))
  4,0 = 1
  4,1 =.969
  3,0 = .75
  2,0 = .5

value = 1   6 spikes followed by alternating spikes decreasing to 
           one every fourth
value = .87 4 spikes followed by alternating spikes decreasing to
           one every fourth
value = .75 1 spike followed by alternating spikes decreasing to 1/4
value = .67 off then spike followed by alternating spikes decreasing to 1/4
value = .5 does fire
value < .5 doesn't fire

threshold = 4
fatigue+  = .6
fatigue-  = .15
decay     = 2
3x3 + = 7.1
3x3 - = -1.5
6x6 + = 7.1/4
6x6 - = -7.1/32
9x9 + = 7.1/9

offon behaves a bit differently
3x3f+ = 7.1/8
3x3f- = -7.1 (something smaller works)
6x6f+ = 7.1/32
6x6f- = -7.1/4
9x9f+ = 7.1/72
9x9f- = -7.1/9
With these weights, value = 1 works the same.  However, down to 
value = 3/8 there is some firing (by 2/8 it stops).  Decay of 2
affects this.  There is no reason this can't change.  
It does however never fire when the centre is on.

LINES
Given this spike behavior, what should be the retinal inputs to
line detectors?  Let's assume that we have a 30x30 network for
each line orientation, and one of those neurons should fire
rapidly if a line (of varying widths) passes through the point
at that orientation. 

If a 1 pixel wide horizontal line passes through x,y than the 3x3 on-off
retina for x,y; x-1,y; and x+1,y will be at .75 so one spike followed
by alternating spikes down to 1/4. It will be .87 if x-1, or x+1 is the end 
of the line. If a 2pixel wide horizontal line passes through x,y than the
6x6 on-off retina for x-y will spike twice followed by alternating spikes.

Lets keep 
threshold 4
fatigue+  = .6
fatigue-  = .15
decay     = 2

3x3 on 4/3 = 1.4
A 3x3 line (no endpoint)

TESTS
There seem to be good tests in machine vision;  you could use
Usama's license plate test with top down information.  You could
also use some of the picture data out there and see if you 
reconstruct good pictures or even clean up dirty data.  This should
also work for negative pictures.

******************************************
I just copied a triangle recognising system to May 02 2006.
Now, I'm going to make a triangle recogniser for different positions.
The saved version is position insensitive, but will activate (the one
neuron) for a lot of things that aren't triangles.
I'll try 6x6 recognisers (so each one overlaps with 2 vertical and 2 horizontal).
That largely works with different neurons coming on in V2.

Now lets try to get V2 to complete.
